Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing quick commerce sales performance 
Quick Commerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

 Overview

This project presents a fully interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyse quick-commerce retail sales performance across products, outlets, and locations. The dashboard was built to simulate a real-world business reporting solution where stakeholders can monitor KPIs, explore outlet performance, and identify revenue-driving product categories.

 Business Problem

Quick-commerce businesses handle large product inventories across multiple outlet locations.
To support operational decisions, they require a consolidated reporting dashboard that can:

- Track overall sales and product distribution
- Identify high-performing outlet locations and sizes
- Analyse product category contribution to revenue
- Monitor outlet establishment trends over time
- Enable fast drill-down from summary metrics to detailed outlet-level insights

This dashboard addresses these needs through interactive reporting and structured data modelling.
